## Northcoders News

Northcoders News is a social news aggregation and discussion site.
It has been built using React, Redux, Bulma and Axios.

Northcoders News has articles which are divided into topics. Each article has user curated ratings and can be up or down voted. Users can add comments about an article. Any comments you post from your app will automatically be given the username 'northcoder'. Comments can also be up or down voted. You can delete your own comments (but not anyone else's!)
